# Leetcode POTDs

Welcome to the **Leetcode Problem of the Day (POTD)** solutions repository. This repository contains my solutions to the daily Leetcode problems. Each month's solutions are organized in their respective folders.

## Folder Structure

The folders are named according to the month and year in the format `YYYY-MM Month`. For example:
- `2024-06 June`
- `2024-07 July`
- `2024-08 August`

### Example
```
Leetcode_POTDs/
├── 2024-06 June/
│   ├── 29.cpp
│   ├── 30.java
│   └── ...
├── 2024-07 July/
│   ├── 01.cpp
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

Each file inside the monthly folders is named according to the day the problem was solved, with an appropriate file extension indicating the programming language used.

## Adding New Solutions

To add new solutions, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the appropriate month folder** or create a new one if it doesn't exist.
2. **Create a new file** named with the day of the month and the appropriate file extension.
   - Example: `01.cpp` for a C++ solution solved on the 1st day of the month.
3. **Write your solution** in the newly created file.
4. **Stage and commit your changes**:
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added solution for [DATE]"
    ```
5. **Push your changes** to the repository:
    ```sh
    git push origin main
    ```
